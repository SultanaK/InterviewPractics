/*  __proto__ is an object in every class instance that points to the prototype it was created from. 
Here, newPhone.__proto__ is a reference to iPhone.prototype, and thus holds the exact same contents as well.
By having a __proto__ property identical to iPhone.prototype, newPhone is essentially saying,
“Look, since I’m an iPhone 11, I have the exact same features as any other iPhone 11! I’ve got Face ID, 
4K video, you name it.” */
